Welcome to the Hemera stable releases project. Here you will find the production
ready releases of the Hemera Application Platform, as well as various documents
to help you get started with the Hemera environment.

## Introdction

Hemera is a high-performance, lightweight, RESTful consumer server application
development platform based on the Java SE platform. It aims to help consumer
application developers to focus on their application specific logic development
without having to worry about the low level system details.

Hemera is designed to have an extremely low learning curve, so you can start working
on your application as quickly as possible, and iterate as often as possible. At the
same time, Hemera provides guidance and enforcements to application server
architecture through its application extension interface, to help improve software
mainability and scalability.

## Design Principles and Features

1. Provide high throughput, high concurrency and high scalability.
2. Extremely easy to use to develop RESTful consumer application server.
3. Provide architectrual guidences and enforcements to help improve software
maintainability and conform to REST principles.
4. Provide complete application packaging, deployment and hosting solutions.
5. Modular design to allow extensions and individual project usages.

## [Getting Started](https://github.com/hemera/Hemera-Release/wiki/Getting-Started)

This is a quick guide to get you started using the Hemera platform. After completing
this guide, you will have the platform installed and understand how to interact
with the platform. This guide will roughly take 5 minutes to complete.

## [Tutorial](https://github.com/hemera/Hemera-Release/wiki/Tutorial)

This is the step by step guide to help you get started using the platform. After
you compelte this guide, you will fully understand how to develop a server
application using the platform, bundle your appication for deployment, and also
deploy your bundle for production. It'll probably take 30 minutes or so to complete.
Then you'll be ready to jump right into your own application development!

## [Debug in Eclipse](https://github.com/hemera/Hemera-Release/wiki/Debug-in-Eclipse)

This is a tutorial covering the topic of how to debug your application in the
Eclipse IDE.

## [Core Concepts](https://github.com/hemera/Hemera-Release/wiki/Core-Concepts)

This document describes various core concepts involved with the platform. This isn't
a must-read to get started. However, if you are interested in how the platform is
put together at a high level, enjoy the read :)

## Advanced Topics

There are several advanced topics related to the design and implementation
of Hemera being discussed in their full details. These documents can be useful
if are looking to understand the design choices and perhaps using them directly.
