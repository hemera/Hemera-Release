# Hemera - Release

Welcome to the Hemera stable releases project. Here you will find the production
ready releases of the Hemera Application Platform, as well as various documents
to help you get started with the Hemera environment.

## Introdction

Hemera is a high-performance, lightweight, RESTful consumer server application
development platform based on the Java SE platform. It aims to help consumer
application developers to focus on their application specific logic development
without having to worry about the low level system details.

Hemera is designed to have an extremely low learning curve, so you can start working
on your application as quickly as possible, and iterate as often as possible. At the
same time, Hemera provides guidance and enforcements to application server
architecture through its application extension interface, to help improve software
mainability and scalability.

## Design Principles and Features

1. Provide high throughput, high concurrency and high scalability.
2. Extremely easy to use to develop RESTful consumer application server.
3. Provide architectrual guidences and enforcements to help improve software
maintainability and conform to REST principles.
4. Provide complete application packaging, deployment and hosting solutions.
5. Modular design to allow extensions and individual project usages.
